    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a fun way to serve the classic mac and cheese. Cheddar cheese is melted and formed into crisp waffle cone
         and mac and cheese is poured in. I made this for a few kids and they loved it...gotta love cheese though.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ounces Cheddar Cheese, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 (7.25 ounce) package Macaroni and Cheese mix</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 ounce sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to brown and cheese is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut melted cheese into squares and form into cones. Freeze cones for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix milk, butter, pepperoni, salt, and cheese packet into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Fill cheese cones with macaroni and cheese.</li>
    </ol>
