# odin-recipe
My first project in Foundations called Recipes

This was a pretty cool project to build out a recipes website.
I learned a lot about links, pictures, paragraphs alt text, unordered, and ordered lists. 
I have a pretty good understanding of the boilerplate now as well.
Im not quite sure of commit comments and where to use them as I didnt really have too many errors etc.
But look forward to learning more about commit comments in further practice and projects. 
Overall it was a pretty good experience being able to put everything I have learned thus far and I look    
forward to the lessons and challenges coming in the future.
